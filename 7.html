I just got it yesterday and have found it really fun. I have found something weird though and I think it‚Äôs some sort of glitch (I will list it in the cons) <br/> Pros- I love that you can add all sorts of effects to the photos and music to the videos and do a whole lot of other stuff to it. I‚Äôve seen that the developer-person actually responds to the reviews when there are problems, which is really nice, cuz I‚Äôve had a lot of other apps and when people say something is wrong, the developer-person doesn‚Äôt ever respond! I am very happy that the people who made this app actually care.<br/> Cons- So I‚Äôve read some other reviews and they say that the app crashes a lot? It hasn‚Äôt happened to me before, but for some reason after I made my first sticker, I couldn‚Äôt find where to make it! Either 1) I completely forgot where it was or 2) the place to make the stickers disappeared. I‚Äôve been looking for it but couldn‚Äôt find it. Hopefully I can find it/ the bug gets fixed. <br/> overall, I think this app is really awesome. By the way, I feel like this app is kind of more on the side of social media rather than a photo/video editor. But honestly, I don‚Äôt really care about that part and this app is great. thanks for reading this :)</p> <h3> <span> Developer Response </span> <span> , </span> </h3> <p> Hi there, thank you for your kind words! It means a lot to us to hear that our users enjoy our app. We will continue to improve the app going forward, so make sure to revisit often! Don‚Äôt forget to revise your review if you‚Äôre satisfied with the app! We will appreciate it a lot.</p> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> leillen </span> <span> , </span> 04/04/2020 <h3> I adore this app, but the CRASHING!!! </h3> <p> Well, I‚Äôm just gonna say right off: I love this app. It has such a variety of everything for editing and you can seriously make some awesome creations on this app. But the worst part is, once you‚Äôve made something with multiple layers of stickers, filtering, drawings, photos, etc., it completely freezes and crashes. I‚Äôve lost so, SO many projects because of this app crashing. I love to edit photos and make wild aesthetic edits with them, but I also love to layer and continuously add things, which the app can‚Äôt handle. After about later 25, if you hit the undo arrow, it‚Äôll load for 15+ minutes and evidently most likely crash. My phone has lots of storage so I know that it‚Äôs the app crashing. I‚Äôve had to just start taking screenshots of my progress every once in awhile in case it crashes I still have a save point (I can‚Äôt save it because I‚Äôm still layering and moving things around).<br/> Overall, I use the sticker feature more out of anything. I love how people can upload their own stickers and such and you can share yours. It‚Äôs a great way to share creativity and really helpful to make cool photos edits. But the app just can‚Äôt handle the excessive layering that I‚Äôm trying to do. I haven‚Äôt heard of any other app that can do this much and NOT give me an annoying watermark on my photo. I‚Äôm not sure how fixable this issue is but if it is, I would be over the moon and definitely change my rating to five stars.<br/> Thank you.</p> <h3> <span> Developer Response </span> <span> , </span> </h3> <p> Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with us! We agree, crashes are the worst. Quick fix: Go to your device Settings ‚Äì Apps ‚Äì PicsArt ‚Äì Storage ‚Äì Clear cache ‚Äì Clear Data. If these steps do not help, please reach out to us at support@picsart.com. We will do our best to resolve the problem you are having!</p> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> Xchashi </span> <span> , </span> 12/22/2019 <h3> Amazing and Easy to use but.. </h3> <p> So the 3 stars is 5 for the actual functionality of the app. It is good, it does work. For all intensive purposes it is a photo editing app that works quite well. I was around before the premium membership and I enjoyed it far more. The ads are whatever I am used to it with free apps. What does bother me though is the new premium membership. Look I understand that you all worked hard on this app and that money is a thing people want. However this is a photo editing app, there is NO NEED to have to pay a MONTHLY membership for photo editing. You know what else charges monthly membership? Netflix, disney +, the ENTIRE adobe creative suite package, and many more services that offer way more than this app. Pay $5.99 a MONTH just for a few filters and no advertisements? That‚Äôs ridiculous. I wont pay for it and being bombarded every 5 seconds by and ad telling me to ‚Äúgo premium‚Äù is starting to annoy me. I used to recommend this app but now I can‚Äôt because I would feel like I am telling people to get the membership and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. Other apps have the exact same package of filters and editing tools with no ads for a ONE TIME payment. They do this for a reason because it‚Äôs a lot easier to convince 20 people to pay a $4.99 one time fee than a reoccurring payment every month. That‚Äôs my suggestion throw out this premium monthly plan and just make it a one time payment. I‚Äôd actually buy that.</p> <h3> <span> Developer Response </span> <span> , </span> </h3> <p> Hi, we are sorry to know that you have faced issues with our PicsArt Gold Subscription Plan.
